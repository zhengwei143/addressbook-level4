== Introduction

Developers usually search google to find solutions to issue/problems, however, bookmarking a certain webpage (where the email is found) does not tell the user much about what was searched (to find that email in the first place). It is likely that if the developer encounters the same issue/problem again, instead of searching through their bookmarks, they would search google and go through all of the links again.

*SaveIt* is geared at keeping track of the issues that the user finds and to link it with the email found on google. More importantly, SaveIt is *optimized for those who prefer to work with a Command Line Interface* (CLI) while still having the benefits of a Graphical User Interface (GUI). If you can type fast, SaveIt can help you search the same issue that save previously faster than traditional GUI apps.

== Quick Start

.  Ensure you have Java version `9` or later installed in your Computer.
.  Download the latest `saveit.jar` link:{repoURL}/releases[here].
.  Copy the file to the folder you want to use as the home folder for your SaveIt.
.  Double-click the file to start the app. The GUI should appear in a few seconds.
.  Type the command in the command box and press Enter to execute it.
    e.g. typing help and pressing Enter will open the help window.
.  Some example commands you can try:
* *`list`* : lists all issues recorded
* *`add`* : add i/ISSUE_STATEMENT s/SOLUTION_LINK1 s/SOLUTION_LINK2 t/TAG1 t/TAG2 : records an issue with the following links where solutions to the issue were found. The issues can be tagged to help with organization and ease of search.
* *`search`* :  Search ISSUE : searches the records for a certain issue (case-insensitive)
* *`edit`* : edit INDEX i/NEW_ISSUE s/NEW_SOLUTION_LINK1 s/NEW_SOLUTION_LINK2…  : edits the details of the 2nd issue in the current list
* *`delete`* :  delete 3 : deletes the 3rd issue shown in the current list
* *`exit`* : .  exit : exits the app
.  Refer to Section 3, “Features” for details of each command.

+
.  Type the command in the command box and press kbd:[Enter] to execute it. +
e.g. typing *`help`* and pressing kbd:[Enter] will open the help window.
.  Some example commands you can try:

* *`list`* : lists all contacts
* **`add`**`n/John Doe p/98765432 e/johnd@example.com a/John street, block 123, #01-01` : adds a contact named `John Doe` to the SaveIt.
* **`delete`**`3` : deletes the 3rd contact shown in the current list
* *`exit`* : exits the app

.  Refer to <<Features>> for details of each command.

[NOTE]
====
Undoable commands: those commands that modify the address book's content (`add`, `delete`, `edit` and `clear`).
====

Examples:

* `delete 1` +
`list chr` +
`undo` (reverses the `delete 1` command) +

* `select 1` +

Format: `redo`

Examples:

* `delete 1` +
`undo` (reverses the `delete 1` command) +
`redo` (reapplies the `delete 1` command) +

* `delete 1` +
`redo` +
The `redo` command fails as there are no `undo` commands executed previously.

* `delete 1` +
`clear` +
`undo` (reverses the `clear` command) +
`undo` (reverses the `delete 1` command) +

=== Listing entered commands : `history`

Lists all the commands that you have entered in reverse chronological order.
Format: `history`

* `add i/Undefined Variable s/www.example1a.com s/www.example1b.com`
* `add i/Segment Fault s/www.example2.com t/JAVA`

[TIP]
====

* Edits the issue at the specified `INDEX`. The index refers to the index number shown in the displayed issue list. The index *must be a positive integer* 1, 2, 3, ...
* At least one of the optional fields must be provided.
* Existing values will be updated to the input values.
* When editing tags, the existing tags of the issue will be removed i.e adding of solutions is not cumulative.
* You can remove all the issue solutions by typing `s/` without specifying any tags after it.
====

Examples:

* `edit 1 r/use String instead of Byte[]`

* `Edits the description of the second issue to be marked as solved and clears all existing solutions.`

=== Refactor Tag: `refactorTag` [coming in v1.2]

To rename or remove a certain tag (for all entries with that tag).

Format: `refactorTag java javascript`

* Changes all entries tagged [java] to be tagged [javascript]

Format: `refactorTag java [null]`

=== Locating issues by name: `serach` [coming in v1.2]

Search issue by tags, issue statement or remarks.
Format: `search KEYWORD [MORE_KEYWORDS]`

[TIP]
====

* The search is case insensitive. e.g hans will match Hans
* The order of the keywords does not matter. e.g. ‘kill port’ will match ‘port kill’
* Searches through the issue statement, tags or remarks.
* Only full words will be matched e.g. Han will not match Hans
* Issues matching at least one keyword will be returned (i.e. OR search). e.g. Hans Bo will return the page and relevant remarks
* Search results will be ordered based on the following priority:
** Issue match > Tag match
====

Examples:

* `find John` +
Returns `john` and `John Doe`
* `find Betsy Tim John` +
Returns any issue having names `Betsy`, `Tim`, or `John`


=== Autosuggestion of (existing) Tags [coming in v1.3]

To prevent the user from creating many similar tags / duplicates, whenever the user creates a record with a tag, or modifies a record’s tag, the application searches for similar tags in the system and prompts the user with a list of similar tags.

Example:

*   add i/NEW_ISSUE t/java
*   Similar tags have been found that have matched with [java], do you mean?
**   Javascript
**   Java9
**   No, i would like to create a new tag [java]
*   tag 1 : chooses to replace [java] with [javascript]
*   tag 3 : chooses to create a new tag [java]


=== Command highlight [coming in v1.3]
Since some commands are quite long, some keywords and parameters are identified to help users to distinguish different information that they input.

Example:

[red]#add# [aqua]#i/ISSUE_STATEMENT# [Green]#s/SOLUTION_LINK1# [Green]#s/SOLUTION_LINK2# [blue]#r/REMARK# [fuchsia]#t/TAG#…​

[red]#edit# [lime]#INDEX# [aqua]#i/NEW_ISSUE# [Green]#s/NEW_SOLUTION_LINK1# [Green]#s/NEW_SOLUTION_LINK2# [fuchsia]#t/TAG1# [Maroon]#r/REMARK1​#

=== Team based - Creating / Switching projects [coming in v2.0]
Records are organized into projects, that way, each project only stores information (bugs/issues) relevant to that project.


=== Team based - Data access from cloud [coming in v2.0]
Developers usually work in teams, and since they are working on the same code base, it is likely that they will encounter the same issues. Developers can be added into projects (mentioned in 3.16), and have access to the same recorded issues that others have added. The data will be hosted on a cloud server so that any updates are accessible by other developers straight away.

* Creating projects: new cs2103project
* Viewing projects: projects
** 1. cs2103project
** 2. cs1010sproject

* Switching projects: switch 1 OR switch cs2103project
