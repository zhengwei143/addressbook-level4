== Overview

This document is to summarize and elaborate all my contributions to the project.

The project, SaveIt, is a issue tracker application which was morphed from AddressBook4. SaveIt targets at programmers and dedicates to provide a platform for storing, managing and viewing their programming related issues during daily practice. It is especially designed for the user who prefers command line interface (CLI) as the all the commands requires command line input. It also preserves the benefits of a Graphical User Interface (GUI) at the same time. If you can type fast, SaveIt can help you search the same statement that save previously faster than traditional GUI apps.

The project is implemented for applying and showing the learning outcomes of CS2103T, and it is done by a group of five CS2103T students including myself.

The main features include:

* Add new issue, new solution or new tags
* Select issue
* Select solution to show the corresponding web page
* Edit existing issue or existing solution
* Rearrange the order of issue list
* Find existing issue according to issue statement or tag

== Summary of contributions

* *Major enhancement*: added the *solution filed to model structure along with enable the add command to add solution or issue*
** What it does: It constitutes the basic model structure by adding new issue and new solution into SaveIt. This allows all the following features to be carried out in SaveIt.
** Justification: This feature improves the product significantly because a user can now add more issues and more solutions to the application. This is the most important and fundamental function our application aims to achieve.
** Highlights: This enhancement involved not only model component but also GUI, storage component in the application and it requires a lot of effort to build it properly. The add command on the other hand needs to handle different request in different directories.

** Credits: _{mention here if you reused any code/ideas from elsewhere or if a third-party library is heavily used in the feature so that a reader can make a more accurate judgement of how much effort went into the feature}_

* *Minor enhancement*:
** Implemented basic autosuggestion feature for find and findByTag command
** Refactored autosuggestion component
** Added retrieve command to copy the solution link to system clipboard
** Refactored the application from AddressBook Level 4 to SaveIt

* *Code contributed*: [https://nus-cs2103-ay1819s1.github.io/cs2103-dashboard/#=undefined&search=leo-1997[Functional code]]
