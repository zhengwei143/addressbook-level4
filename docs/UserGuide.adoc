== Introduction

Developers usually search google to find solutions to technical problems. However, bookmarking a certain web-page does not tell developers much about for which problem they searched. If developers encounter the same problem again, instead of searching through their bookmarks, it is likely for them to search on google again.

*SaveIt* is geared at keeping track of the issues that users find and linking it with solution web-page found on google. More importantly, SaveIt is *optimized for those who prefer to work with a Command Line Interface (CLI)* while still has the benefits of a Graphical User Interface (GUI). If you can type fast, SaveIt can help you search the entry saved previously faster than traditional GUI apps.


== Quick Start

To get started with SaveIt, please follow the  instructions below:

.  Ensure that Java version `9` or later is installed in your Computer.
.  Download the latest `saveit.jar` link:{repoURL}/releases[here].
.  Copy the file to a folder as the home folder for your SaveIt.
.  Double-click the file to start the app. The GUI should appear in a few seconds, as shown below.
+
.Application Interface

+
.  Type the command in the command box and press kbd:[Enter] to execute it. +
e.g. typing *`help`* and pressing kbd:[Enter] will open the help window.
.  Try some example commands:

* *`list`* : lists all issues
* **`add`**`i/map_function d/How to use map function in python t/python` : records a issue of map function with description "How to use map function in python" tagged as "python"
* **`delete`**`3` : deletes the 3rd issue shown in the current list
* *`exit`* : exits the app


[[Features]]
== Features
The following is a list of commands that you can use in the application.

*Command Format*

====
* Words in `UPPER_CASE` are the parameters to be provided by the user e.g. in `add i/ISSUE_STATEMENT d/DESCRIPTION`, `ISSUE_STATEMENT` and `DESCRIPTION` are parameters which can be used as `add i/Segment_Fault d/java`.
* Items in square brackets are optional e.g `i/ISSUE_STATEMENT d/DESCRIPTION [t/TAG]` can be used as `i/map_function d/how to use map in python t/python` or as `i/map_function d/how to use in python`.
* Items with `…`​ after them can be used multiple times including zero times e.g. `[t/TAG]...` can be used as `{nbsp}` (i.e. 0 times), `t/python`, `t/python t/java` etc.
* Parameters can be in any order e.g. if the command specifies `t/TAG, d/DESCRIPTION i/ISSUE_STATEMENT` is also acceptable.
* Command alias can be used instead of lengthy command words.
====

=== Viewing help : `(h)help`

Type `help` to view the handy help page!

Format: `help`

Examples:
****
* `help`
****

=== Selecting an issue/solution  : `(s)select`

If the user is at the home directory, the command selects
 an issue identified by the index number used in the issue panel.
  The command also displays the solutions
  of the selected issue in the solution panel. Now the edit directory
is changed to issue level.

[TIP]
====
* When an issue is selected, the directory is changed to `SaveIt/Issue */`. Then
the user is not allowed to add, edit, or select issue.
The change directory will be displayed in the UI as shown below.
====
Format: `select INDEX`

Example:
****
.Direcotry Change
image::directory-change.png[width="300"]
.Select an Issue
image::select issue.png[width="790"]
****
If the user is at the issue directory, the command load the web link
 of the indexed solution in the built-in browser.

Example:
****
* `select 2`

.Seleting a Solution
image::select solution.png[width="790"]
****



[NOTE]
====
* The index refers to the index number shown in the list.

* Creation is considered as modification, i.e. last modified time is set to created time when an issue is added.
====

// tag::suggestion[]
=== Autosuggesting existing issue in find command
To prevent the issue list is so large such that user can hardly remember all the issues, whenever user types in any keyword in find command, SaveIt will auto suggest any related issue name according to the keyword entered.

Example:

.Autosuggesting of exsiting issues statements
image::FindIssueAutoSuggestion.png[width="500"]
// end::suggestion[]

=== Autosuggesting existing tags in findByTag command

To prevent the user from creating many similar tags / duplicates, whenever the user creates a record with a tag, or modifies a record’s tag, the application searches for similar tags in the system and prompts the user with a list of similar tags.

Example:

.Autosuggesting of existing tags
image::autosuggest-tag.png[width="500"]


=== Suggesting to copy existing values
When editing fields in an issue (e.g. Editing an issue statement), if only slight modifications are required, the user will have to copy paste the existing issue statement and modify it, or type it out again.
To make things more convenient, after the application prompts the user if they want to copy the existing value onto the command line.

Example:

.Copying existing fields
image::copy-existing.png[width="790"]

// tag::commandhighlight[]

=== Highlighting command parameters

When the user types the command in the command line, it is difficult for users to distinguish their inputs and parameters. Hence command gets highlighted is essential to differentiate the parameter and values that user input.

Examples:
****
.Command highlight 1
image::command-highlight1.png[width="700"]

.Command highlight 2
image::command-highlight2.png[width="700"]
****

[NOTE]
====
* The command word will be highlight no matter it is valid or not.
* The index will be highlight only for certain commands required index (e.g. `edit`, `select`).

====
// end::commandhighlight[]


=== Team based - Creating / Switching projects [coming in v2.0]
Records are organized into projects, that way, each project only stores information (bugs/issues) relevant to that project.


=== Team based - Data access from cloud [coming in v2.0]
Developers usually work in teams, and since they are working on the same code base, it is likely that they will encounter the same issues. Developers can be added into projects (mentioned in 3.16), and have access to the same recorded issues that others have added. The data will be hosted on a cloud server so that any updates are accessible by other developers straight away.

* Creating projects: new cs2103project
* Viewing projects: projects
** 1. cs2103project
** 2. cs1010sproject

* Switching projects: switch 1 OR switch cs2103project

=== Highlighting the page : `highlight` [coming in v2.0]
Highlights the certain part of the page that shows on the window, use an annotation box.
Format: `highlight`
