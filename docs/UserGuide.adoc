== Introduction

Developers usually search google to find solutions to statement/problems, however, bookmarking a certain webpage (where the email is found) does not tell the user much about what was searched (to find that email in the first place). It is likely that if the developer encounters the same statement/problem again, instead of searching through their bookmarks, they would search google and go through all of the links again.

*SaveIt* is geared at keeping track of the issues that the user finds and to link it with the email found on google. More importantly, SaveIt is *optimized for those who prefer to work with a Command Line Interface* (CLI) while still having the benefits of a Graphical User Interface (GUI). If you can type fast, SaveIt can help you search the same statement that save previously faster than traditional GUI apps.

== Quick Start

.  Ensure you have Java version `9` or later installed in your Computer.
.  Download the latest `saveit.jar` link:{repoURL}/releases[here].
.  Copy the file to the folder you want to use as the home folder for your SaveIt.
.  Double-click the file to start the app. The GUI should appear in a few seconds.
.  Type the command in the command box and press Enter to execute it.
    e.g. typing help and pressing Enter will open the help window.
.  Some example commands you can try:
* *`list`* : lists all issues recorded
* *`add`* : add i/ISSUE_STATEMENT s/SOLUTION_LINK1 s/SOLUTION_LINK2 t/TAG1 t/TAG2 : records an statement with the following links where solutions to the statement were found. The issues can be tagged to help with organization and ease of search.
* *`search`* :  Search ISSUE : searches the records for a certain statement (case-insensitive)
* *`edit`* : edit INDEX i/NEW_ISSUE s/NEW_SOLUTION_LINK1 s/NEW_SOLUTION_LINK2…  : edits the details of the 2nd statement in the current list
* *`delete`* :  delete 3 : deletes the 3rd statement shown in the current list
* *`exit`* : .  exit : exits the app
.  Refer to Section 3, “Features” for details of each command.

+
.  Type the command in the command box and press kbd:[Enter] to execute it. +
e.g. typing *`help`* and pressing kbd:[Enter] will open the help window.
.  Some example commands you can try:

* *`list`* : lists all contacts
* **`add`**`n/John Doe p/98765432 e/johnd@example.com a/John street, block 123, #01-01` : adds a contact named `John Doe` to the SaveIt.
* **`delete`**`3` : deletes the 3rd contact shown in the current list
* *`exit`* : exits the app

.  Refer to <<Features>> for details of each command.

=== Selecting an statement : `select`

Selects the issue identified by the index number used in the displayed issue list and change the current editing directory to the issue selected.
Format: `select INDEX`


[NOTE]
====
* Selects the issue and loads the first solution link of the issue at the specified `INDEX`.
* The index refers to the index number shown in the displayed issue list.

[NOTE]
====
Undoable commands: those commands that modify the address book's content (`add`, `delete`, `edit` and `clear`).
====

Examples:

* `delete 1` +
`list chr` +
`undo` (reverses the `delete 1` command) +

* `select 1` +
`list chr` +
`undo` +
The `undo` command fails as there are no undoable commands executed previously.

`clear` +
`undo` (reverses the `clear` command) +
`undo` (reverses the `delete 1` command) +


=== Redoing the previously undone command : `redo`

Reverses the most recent `undo` command. +
Format: `redo`

Examples:

* `delete 1` +
`undo` (reverses the `delete 1` command) +
`redo` (reapplies the `delete 1` command) +

* `delete 1` +
`redo` +
The `redo` command fails as there are no `undo` commands executed previously.

* `delete 1` +
`clear` +
`undo` (reverses the `clear` command) +
`undo` (reverses the `delete 1` command) +
`redo` (reapplies the `delete 1` command) +
`redo` (reapplies the `clear` command)

=== Listing entered commands : `history`

Lists all the commands that you have entered in reverse chronological order.
Format: `history`

[NOTE]
====
Pressing the kbd:[&uarr;] and kbd:[&darr;] arrows will display the previous and next input respectively in the command box.
====

Format: `list`

[TIP]
====
The default result of list command is listing all issues in a chronological order.
====


Format: `list p2 chr`
[TIP]
====

Format: `home`

[TIP]
====
All issues are listed in chronological order by default.
====

=== Editing an issue : `edit` [coming in v1.2]


Edits an existing statement in the statement list. +
Format: `edit INDEX i/NEW_ISSUE s/NEW_SOLUTION_LINK1 s/NEW_SOLUTION_LINK2 t/TAG1 r/REMARK1​`

[TIP]
====

* Edits the statement at the specified `INDEX`. The index refers to the index number shown in the displayed statement list. The index *must be a positive integer* 1, 2, 3, ...
* At least one of the optional fields must be provided.
* Existing values will be updated to the input values.
* When editing tags, the existing tags of the statement will be removed i.e adding of solutions is not cumulative.
* You can remove all the statement solutions by typing `s/` without specifying any tags after it.
====

Examples:

* `edit 1 r/use String instead of Byte[]`
* `Edits the email of the 1st bug encountered is to use a string instead of a Byte array.`
* `Edit 2 i/solved s/`
* `Edits the description of the second statement to be marked as solved and clears all existing solutions.`

=== Refactor Tag: `refactorTag` [coming in v1.2]

To rename or remove a certain tag (for all entries with that tag).

Format: `refactorTag java javascript`

* Changes all entries tagged [java] to be tagged [javascript]

Format: `refactorTag java [null]`

* Removes the tag [java] from all the entries

=== Locating issues by statement: `find`

Search issue by statement or description.
Format: `find KEYWORD [MORE_KEYWORDS]`

[TIP]
====

* The search is case insensitive. e.g hans will match Hans
* The order of the keywords does not matter. e.g. ‘kill port’ will match ‘port kill’
* Searches through the issue statement or description.
* The keywords can partially match the statement or description.
* Issues matching at least one keyword will be returned.
* Searching the keyword will increment the search frequency of the issue (so that it can be ordered accordingly later on).
====

Examples:

* `find John` +
Returns `john` and `John Doe`
* `find Betsy Tim John` +
Returns any statement having names `Betsy`, `Tim`, or `John`


=== Autosuggestion of (existing) Tags [coming in v1.3]

To prevent the user from creating many similar tags / duplicates, whenever the user creates a record with a tag, or modifies a record’s tag, the application searches for similar tags in the system and prompts the user with a list of similar tags.

Example:

*   add i/NEW_ISSUE t/java
*   Similar tags have been found that have matched with [java], do you mean?
**   Javascript
**   Java9
**   No, i would like to create a new tag [java]
*   tag 1 : chooses to replace [java] with [javascript]
*   tag 3 : chooses to create a new tag [java]


=== Command highlight [coming in v1.3]
Since some commands are quite long, some keywords and parameters are identified to help users to distinguish different information that they input.

Example:

[red]#add# [aqua]#i/ISSUE_STATEMENT# [Green]#s/SOLUTION_LINK1# [Green]#s/SOLUTION_LINK2# [blue]#r/REMARK# [fuchsia]#t/TAG#…​

[red]#edit# [lime]#INDEX# [aqua]#i/NEW_ISSUE# [Green]#s/NEW_SOLUTION_LINK1# [Green]#s/NEW_SOLUTION_LINK2# [fuchsia]#t/TAG1# [Maroon]#r/REMARK1​#

=== Team based - Creating / Switching projects [coming in v2.0]
Records are organized into projects, that way, each project only stores information (bugs/issues) relevant to that project.


=== Team based - Data access from cloud [coming in v2.0]
Developers usually work in teams, and since they are working on the same code base, it is likely that they will encounter the same issues. Developers can be added into projects (mentioned in 3.16), and have access to the same recorded issues that others have added. The data will be hosted on a cloud server so that any updates are accessible by other developers straight away.

* Creating projects: new cs2103project
* Viewing projects: projects
** 1. cs2103project
** 2. cs1010sproject

* Switching projects: switch 1 OR switch cs2103project
